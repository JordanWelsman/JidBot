_Jordan's Multifunctional Discord Bot_

## Description

`JidBot` is a small, single-author _Discord_ bot intended for use in servers maintained by small communities or groups of friends. It comes with games, en economy, and some other fun stuff. Eventually there will be a GitHub wiki for this bot. It's still under development and is developed as a pet project of Jordan's while he gets his Raspberry Pi cluster up and running.
